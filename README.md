This will find the smallest integer that can be formed by removing duplicate digits from the input. The final input must contain every digit that can be found in the input (including possibly a leading ‘0’). Digits may not be swapped or otherwise rearranged. They may only be removed, and may be removed only if the same digit occurs elsewhere in the number.
